                <div class="text-section" style="padding-right: 5rem;">
                    <p>My name is <strong>Charles Joshua Chakma</strong>, and I was born and raised in Chandraghona, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Growing up in a Christian family in a predominantly Muslim country, I faced many challenges. In Bangladesh, Christians make up only about 0.4% of the population. As a child, I was constantly surrounded by people of other faiths in my schools and neighborhood. These experiences shaped my early identity and understanding of faith.

                        <br>Although I was raised in a godly household—my father a pastor and my mother a devoted woman leader—I later realized that, for much of my early life, I was only going through the motions of Christianity. It wasn’t until my late teenage years that I truly understood what it meant to surrender my heart to Christ. That moment became the turning point of my spiritual journey.
                        
                       <br>I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which has equipped me with valuable technical skills. However, my deepest passion lies in serving God and sharing His message. My upbringing, spiritual transformation, and the influence of my parents' ministry have inspired me to pursue a life devoted to advancing God’s kingdom.

                <div class="text-section text-left" style="padding-left: 5rem;">
                    <p>I grew up in a Christian family where faith was lived out in front of me daily. My parents were strong role models, and I followed the Christian traditions they taught me. At first, my devotion to God was sincere, but as I grew older and encountered different people and beliefs, my relationship with God became more about routine and pride. I began to rely on my biblical knowledge, seeking to impress others rather than truly connecting with Christ. In my pride, I thought my faith made me better than others.

                        <br>The turning point came when God opened my eyes to the reality that my faith was missing the depth of love, humility, and genuine devotion that He desires. I was convicted by the truth that I had been living for myself, not for God. In that moment, I realized that my relationship with Christ had been built on self-righteousness rather than a true commitment to follow Him.
                        
                        <br>In 2020, I repented of my pride and surrendered my life to Jesus. I accepted Him not only as my Savior but also as the Lord of my life, and I was baptized as a public declaration of my newfound faith. That moment marked the beginning of a true transformation in my life.
                        
                        <br>Since then, God has continued to shape me, particularly through my involvement with different ministry and my parent's ministry work . Through meditation getting spiritual maturity and Trying to preach and share the gospel. Today, I continue to grow in humility and deepen my relationship with God, seeking to live according to His will.
                        
                        <br>My heart is now set on becoming a spiritual leader who listens, understands, and walks alongside others, sharing the hope and love of Jesus with those around me.

            <h2>My Vision for The Kingdom</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>My vision is to become a passionate servant of Christ, growing in both my knowledge and character. I
                    desire to be a leader who leads by example, pointing people to Christ through my actions and words.
                    I want to be someone who loves deeply, listens with compassion, and shares the gospel with humility.
                    Through continual growth in both knowledge and character, I aim to guide others to a deeper
                    understanding of God’s message and their purpose in His Kingdom.
                    <br>As I live in a modern age, I also dream of using my technical skills to connect with people
                    through
                    social media and online platforms. Since many in Bangladesh primarily understand Bangla, I want to
                    create a social media platform that provides easy Bangla translations. My future goal is to build a
                    dedicated team that will work alongside me to translate foreign-language sermons, lectures, and
                    gospel messages into Bangla, ensuring that everyone can access and understand the truth of God’s
                    Word in their heart language.
                    <br>This platform will serve as a lifeline for those who do not have a church nearby or cannot
                    attend
                    one for various reasons. Additionally, many Muslims converts in Bangladesh face persecution and
                    cannot openly proclaim their faith in Christ without severe consequences. For them, this platform
                    will provide a safe space where they can attend an online church, receive spiritual nourishment, and
                    grow in their faith without fear.
                    <br>I believe that by living with grace and unwavering faith, I can help others experience the
                    transformative power of God’s love, just as I have. My heart’s desire is to equip others to walk in
                    the fullness of their faith, whether they are new to Christianity or have been walking with the Lord
                    for many years. I long to see a world where people are not just aware of Christ but truly know
                    Him—living in relationship with Him and fully embracing the purpose He has for them.

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>In Bangladesh, Muslims constitute about 91% of the population, and Christianity remains a minority
                    faith. Unfortunately, misconceptions about Jesus and Christianity are widespread among the Muslim
                    population. Many of my Muslim friends and neighbours have misconceptions about who Jesus is, and
                    often, they are taught a distorted version of His identity. These misconceptions, along with
                    stereotypes and misunderstandings, make it challenging to have open conversations about faith. <br>But I
                    see a significant opportunity to bridge these gaps and reach out to those who have not yet
                    encountered the truth. I am deeply burdened for the Muslim people of Bangladesh and feel a strong
                    calling to engage with them in love and humility. Through sharing the message of Jesus, I hope to
                    address these misconceptions and promote a more accurate understanding of Christianity. I believe
                    that by breaking down barriers of misunderstanding and showing them the truth of who Jesus really
                    is, I can help lead them to faith in Him. 
                    <br>As it is written in <strong>Matthew 28:19-20, “Go therefore and

                    <h5>My Dream of Studying Theology Abroad</h5>
                    <!-- Answer -->
                    <div class="qna-answer">
                        <p>
                            My dream of studying theology abroad is rooted in a deep desire to grow closer to God and be
                            equipped to serve others more effectively. I long to study in a seminary located in a
                            different country—a place with a new culture, where I can be surrounded by fellow believers
                            who are passionate about knowing and living out the Word of God.

                            <br>Being in such a country would give me the opportunity to experience authentic
                            testimonies, witness the power of faith in action, and immerse myself in an environment that
                            nurtures spiritual maturity. I believe that such an atmosphere will challenge and transform
                            me, helping me to better understand God's Word and apply it in my own life and ministry.

                            <br>This dream is not just about education; it’s about preparation. I want to learn how to
                            preach the Gospel clearly, how to counsel those in need, how to reach out with genuine love,
                            and how to disciple others faithfully. Most importantly, I want to return home better
                            equipped to engage with the Muslim community I live among—sharing the love of Christ in a
                            way that is respectful, compassionate, and effective.

                            <br>Studying theology abroad is no longer just a desire—it feels like a calling from God. I
                            believe He has already begun to open doors, and I trust that He will continue to guide me as
                            I take each step forward in faith.
